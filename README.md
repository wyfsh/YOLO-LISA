# YOLO-LISA

A real-time traffic sign detection based on [YOLOv2](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242)).

The model was trained on [LISA-TS Dataset](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/vivachallenge/index.php/signs/sign-detection/), a dataset of US traffic signs.

See [notes](notes.txt) (Chinese) for details.
